# DEPT Agency Case

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.8. and node v18.3.0.

The goal of the assignment was to reproduce a given web design. With the given the time, I chose to focus on the following:

- Make it fully responsive. Add breakpoints for mobile, tablet and desktop.
- Add Contact form with validation and error and success states.
- Animations on scroll, hover, on click
- Lazyload to improve performance 

Also took a couple of liberties with the design to reproduce animations of the real website and have a bit more fun with it.

# How to run project
